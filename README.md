This repository contains Python code demonstrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The primary goal of this script is to visually explain the core mechanics of PCA, including:
  1. Generating a linearly correlated dataset.
  2. Calculating and visualizing the Principal Components (PC1 and PC2).
  3. Projecting the original data points onto the new PC axes.
  4. Applying PCA to a standard dataset (like IRIS) to demonstrate clustering in a 2D plot.
