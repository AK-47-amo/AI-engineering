This repository contains Python code demonstrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
The primary goal of this script is to visually explain the core mechanics of PCA, including:

Generating a linearly correlated dataset.

Calculating and visualizing the Principal Components (PC1 and PC2).

Projecting the original data points onto the new PC axes.

Applying PCA to a standard dataset (like IRIS) to demonstrate clustering in a 2D plot.
